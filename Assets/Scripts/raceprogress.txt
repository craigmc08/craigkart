plan for calculating lap progression:

keep track of current checkpoint

each update, compute distance to last passed checkpoint (including key checkpoints) and distance to next checkpoint.

first idea for distance to checkpoint: simple distance to center

with n checkpoints (including key checkpoints), current checkpoint m,
a distance to previous p and a distance to next q, lap progress is:

LP = m/n + p/(n(p+q))

current problems:
there is discontinuities in the progress function at checkpoints due to the test sphere radius. not sure of the
best way to solve this...
