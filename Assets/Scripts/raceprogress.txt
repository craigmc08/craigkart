current problem:
if you enter checkpoint 0 from the back, then exit from the back, your lap
count still increases. you can then drive to the last checkpoint, enter it
forwards and drive to checkpoint 0. you then get a new lap count.
also, it can cause a desynch between key checkpoints and normal checkpoints

possible fix: only trigger checkpoint events when exiting a checkpoint.

this means the start checkpoint should be testSphereRadius units behind the start line.
